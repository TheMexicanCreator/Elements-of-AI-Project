# ChatGPT Clone

This is the final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This is a project in which the user will ask the AI for new input and then the AI will use results to help them achieve their desired answers. In addition, the user can ask for information regarding programming, lifestyle, finance, etc.

## Background

This idea solves the following problems:
1. Fixing the code of a program.
2. Solve doubts regarding any topic.
3. Providing more concise answers to the problem.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

## Data sources and AI methods

Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

This clone is not advanced as the main ChatGPT, it might give some confusing or wrong answers sometimes.

## What next?

This is just a small piece of what AI can do. In the future, I'll make other projects that are related to AI.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank Elements of AI, Microsoft and OpenAI for inspiring me to start this new AI journey I'm becoming a part of.
